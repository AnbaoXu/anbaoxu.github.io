<h2>Short Bio</h2>
<p>An-Bao Xu received the M.S. degree in computational mathematics from the Gulin University of Electronic Technology, Gulin, China, in 2013, and the Ph.D. degree from Hunan University, Changsha, China, in 2017. From 2014 to 2016, he was an exchange Ph.D. student in Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Auburn University. 
He is currently a Lecturer with the College of Mathematics and Physics, Wenzhou University. His main research activities are focused on the application of numerical linear algebra and sparse optimization in image processing.    </p>
